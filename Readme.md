The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com).
2. Click on **New Project**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository.
4. Set up environment variables (same as `.env.local`).
5. Deploy the project.

Your app will be live with automatic deployments on every push to the main branch.
